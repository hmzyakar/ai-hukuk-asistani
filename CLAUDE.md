## 1. Project Summary

**Objective:** To develop a prototype "AI Legal Assistant" for lawyers in Turkey, automating the daily tracking of the Official Gazette (Resm√Æ Gazete).
**Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit, BeautifulSoup, Google Gemini API.
**Development Environment:** A Docker container with Python, Node.js, and Claude Code installed.
**Workflow:**
1.  Daily regulations are scraped from the Official Gazette using `src/scraper.py`.
2.  Each scraped text is analyzed, summarized, and categorized by the Gemini model via `src/analyzer.py`.
3.  The results are displayed in a Streamlit user interface powered by `src/app.py`.

## 2. File Structure and Current Status

The project follows a modular structure under the `src` directory.

-   `src/scraper.py`:
    -   `get_todays_gazette_url()`: **Completed and tested.** Dynamically generates the URL for the current date.
    -   `fetch_regulation_links(url)`: **In Progress - Debugging by saving raw HTML output.** Adding debug code to save HTML content for analysis.
    -   `fetch_text_from_url(url)`: **Completed and tested.** Extracts clean text from a given regulation link.
    -   **STATUS: In Progress - Debugging `fetch_regulation_links` by saving raw HTML output.**

-   `src/analyzer.py`:
    -   `setup_ai_model()`: **Completed and tested.** Reads the Google API key from the `.env` file and configures the Gemini model.
    -   `summarize_and_categorize_text(model, text)`: **Completed and tested.** Summarizes and categorizes the given text using Gemini and returns the result in the correct format.
    -   **STATUS: Development of this module is complete.**

-   `src/app.py`:
    -   **STATUS: In Progress.** The basic UI skeleton and buttons are in place. Currently implementing the main workflow that calls functions from the `scraper` and `analyzer` modules.

-   `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `.env`:
    -   **STATUS:** Created and populated with all necessary content.

## 3. Current Task

**Next Task:** Refactoring the entire `scraper.py` module to use Selenium WebDriver for robust, JavaScript-aware scraping. Replacing all `requests` calls.
